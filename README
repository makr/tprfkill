I am currently writing this, because my ThinkPad X200s always starts into Linux
with all rf devices switched on. This script should give me the possibility to
dump the state of the devices at shutdown and when booting up reload the states
again. Thus only having, e.g. wlan switched on. Eventually there will also be a
small GUI for a quick overview and easy switching of the states. If possible I
will even try to bind the GUI to FN+F5 then.

Currently, however, only reading of the states is implemented.

Usage: ./tprfkill.tcl read

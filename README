-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intention
---------

I wrote it, because my ThinkPad X200s always starts into Linux with all rf
devices (bluetooth, wlan, wwan, etc.) switched on. This script now gives me the
possibility to dump the state of the devices at shutdown and restore them when
booting up again. Thus only having, e.g. wwan switched on.

Open Topics
-----------

Eventually there will also be a small GUI for a quick overview and easy
switching of the states. If possible I will even try to bind the GUI to FN+F5
then.

Prerequisites
-------------

The script is a Tcl script and needs a Tcl interpreter of at least version 8.5.
To check if one is installed you may use your package manager or check manually,
e.g. like so:
$ which tclsh
/usr/bin/tclsh
$ echo 'puts [info patchlevel]' | tclsh
8.5.7

Installation
------------

To use the main functionality (restoring of the device states after boot up) the
script has to be installed:

1. become root or use sudo for the following steps
2. review and execute install.sh in the source directory
3. run the script once to save the current state locally, e.g. tprfkill.tcl save
4. edit the settings to match your desired configuration
5. run the script again to load the settings, e.g. tprfkill.tcl reset

Note: The local settings will not be read by dump and restore. Step 3-5 are only
meant to setup the currently desired configuration.

Usage
-----

tprfkill.tcl read
 Prints a line like "name (type) at file is state", e.g.
 tpacpi_bluetooth_sw (bluetooth) at rfkill1 is soft_blocked

tprfkill.tcl save
 Will save the current rfkill status of the devices in the local settings at
 "~/.tprfkillrc". This can be used as template to edit for use by "reset".
 Possible values are
  soft_blocked => device should be off
  unblocked => device should be on
  keep => do not touch this device

tprfkill.tcl reset
 Reset the state of all devices from the defaults, e.g. as loaded from the local
 settings.

tprfkill.tcl dump
 Dump the current status of the rfkill devices in a simple machine readable
 file. This should only be used by the init-script.

tprfkill.tcl restore
 Restore the previously dumped status of the rfkill devices. This should only be
 used by the init-script.

tprfkill.tcl all on|off
 Switch all devices on (unblocked) or off (soft_blocked).
